# network-sampling

## Old code

Check out `src/old_sampling_code.py` for some old and messy code that does a bad version of the task we want to do.

## Todo list

1. Principled way to generate homophily in graphs (edge stubs?)
2. Statistical method for testing the hypothesis "samples accurately" (bootstrap replications?)
3. Multiple attributes with correlation between them
4. Formalization to look like RDS

## Some coding conventions

* Use python 3
* Write lots of little functions
* Use NetworkX for graph
* Use numpy tools where available
* Update this README regularly
