## Estimating group properties in online networks with a classifier

This is the repo for the paper [Estimating group properties in online social networks with a classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09406.pdf) on combining network sampling and classification of group proportions.

We are grateful for the research by [Karimi et al 2017](https://github.com/frbkrm/HomophilicNtwMinorities), which we used for the graph generation procedure in simulations.

You can check out the [SNAP datasets](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-pokec.html) for the Pokec graph we use.
