# network-sampling

## Old code

Check out `src/old_sampling_code.py` for some old and messy code that does a bad version of the task we want to do.

## Some coding conventions

* Use python 3
* Write lots of little functions
* Use NetworkX for graph
* Use numpy tools where available
* Update this README regularly

## Analyses
1. Visibility accuracy
1. Majority group size accuracy
1. Cross link proportion accuracy
1. Homophily accuracy

## Paremeters
1. Without classifier error
1. With classifier error
1. As the sample gets bigger

## Networks
1. Simulated parameter space
1. Pokec
1. Sexual

## Sampling methods
1. Edge
1. Node
1. Ego network
1. Snowball
1. RDS

This gives 3 parmeters, 3 network types, and 5 sampling methods for a total of 45 analyses

This is too many

We are going to do the full gamut for the 5 sampling methods on the simulated parameter space.

What will these plots look like?

## Types of plots to make
1. Accuracy at sampling fraction for simulated graphs and 5 sampling methods
1. Accuracy at sampling fraction with correction for simulated graphs and 5 sampling methods
1. Bias for a fixed sampling size (1000 nodes) for simulated graphs with 5 sampling methods
1. Bias for a fixed sampling size (1000 nodes) for simulated graphs with 5 sampling methods with correction
